Program for computing an exact MSM Median for a set of k time series (of unequal lengths).  
Previously, the problem was called MSM-Mean. Following a reviewer's suggestion, we now use the name
MSM-Median since the aim is to minimize the sum of distances instead of the sum of squared distances.
However, the code referred to a mean instead of a median
Run the main method in the MsmMean file for computing a small example. 
Use the MsmMeanMaxLengths file for computing a MSM Mean at least as long as the longest input time series.
